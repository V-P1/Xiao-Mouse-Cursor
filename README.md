# Instructions
For the one person who noticed it!

1. Click on the 'Xiao.ani' file
2. Click on 'view raw' under the file to download it

Unfortunately I can only give specific windows instructions because I don't have Mac but it should be similar!

3. Click on computer settings
4. Go to personalize
5. Go to themes
6. Go to mouse and cursor
7. Click browse
8. Select your cursor
9. Press apply
10. And lastly, save it as a theme!

Hope you enjoy :)
